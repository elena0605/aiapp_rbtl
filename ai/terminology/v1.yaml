nodes:
  Person: "This node represents the young people or participants in our study, basically the people whose behavior and preferences we are analyzing. When someone says 'youth', 'participants', or 'people', they should think of this node. This node NEVER REPRESENTS AN INFLUENCER."
  Influencer: "Influencers are individuals who create content online. In our graph model, influencers can be either on Tiktok (TikTokUser) or YouTube (YouTubeChannel) social media platforms. Our participants name these influencers as those they follow on social media platforms. So, an Influencer node captures these popular figures the participants (Person node) care about."
  Area: "The Area node represents a specific geographic neighborhood or district where a participant lives. Currently, in our graph schema only areas within Rotterdam Municipality are supported. Never generate a cypher query when area that doesn't belong to Rotterdam municipality is requested. For instance, Charlois or Feijenoord would be valid Area nodes. Area nodes help us group people by where they reside, and derive area-based differences in behaviours."
  Municipality: "This is a larger administrative region that includes many Areas. For example, Rotterdam itself is a Municipality containing various Areas. We only support municipalities coming from the Rotterdam Rijmond Region. Never generate a cypher query when municipality that doesn't belong to Rotterdam Rijmond region is requested. "
  TikTokUser: "This node stands for a TikTok account that belongs to an Influencer. It's the representation of the influencer's presence on the TikTok platform."
  YouTubeChannel: "Similar to TiktokUser, this node represents an Influencer's YouTube channel, reflecting their presence on YouTube."
  TikTokVideo: "Tiktok Videos are the pieces of content published by TikTok influencers. These nodes capture details related to video content published by the TikTok influencer."
  YouTubeVideo: "YouTube Videos are the pieces of content published by Youtube influencers (YouTubeChannel). These nodes capture details related to video content published by the YouTube influencer."
  TikTokComment: "TikTok Comments are user interactions on TikTok videos. They can be from followers or viewers engaging with the content, or the influencers themselves. Sometimes comments have replies, which are also captured as nodes."
  YouTubeComment: "Comments are user interactions on videos. They can be from followers or viewers engaging with the content, and sometimes comments have replies, which are also captured as nodes."
  TikTokHashTag: "On TikTok, hashtags capture the keywords used on TikTok videos. TikTokHashTag nodes help categorize and spread content within the platform."
  TikTokSticker: "On TikTok, stickers are graphic elements added to TikTok videos. The TikTokSticker node represents these decorations and nuances in video content."
  YoutubeVideoTag: "Tags on YouTube videos work like keywords, and the Tag node captures these to help categorize YouTubeVideo by topic or theme."
  YoutubeVideoTopic: "Topic nodes on youtube videos represent the subject matter or themes of videos, like 'news', 'sports', or 'entertainment'. This helps us analyze what kinds of content participants are being exposed to."
relationships:
  LIVES_IN_AREA: "This relationship connects a Person node to the Area node where they live. It tells us the geographic context (on area level) of each participant. Area is part of a municipality. The only area-level data we have is from Rotterdam's municipality areas."
  LIVES_IN_MUNICIPALITY: "This relationship connects a Person node to the Municipality node where they live. It tells us the geographic context (on municipality level) of each participant. We only support municipalities from Rotterdam Rijmond Region."
  BELONGS_TO: "An Area belongs to a Municipality, so this relationship represents the geographic hierarchy—like a neighborhood inside a city."
  HAS_ACCOUNT: "This connects an Influencer to their TikTok or YouTube platform accounts (TikTokUser or YouTubeChannel), forming a bridge between the person and their social media presence on TikTok or YouTube."
  HAS_VIDEO: "This relationship shows that an influencer, i.e. TikTokUser or YouTubeChannel published a particular video—in other words, it captures content creation."
  HAS_TAG: "Indicates that a Youtube or TikTok video includes a specific hashtag (TikTokHashTag or YoutubeVideoTag), helping us track how videos are categorized or spread."
  HAS_STICKER: "Connects a TikTok video to stickers used, showing the extra graphic details added to videos."
  HAS_COMMENT: "Links a TikTokVideo or YouTubeVideo to comments made by viewers or followers (TikTokComment or YouTubeComment), capturing audience engagement."
  HAS_TOPIC: "This connects a YouTube video to its Topic, specifying what the content is about. This helps us analyze trends in exposure and content types participants consume."
  FOLLOWS: "This relationship shows that a Person follows an Influencer on a social media platform. It tells us which influencers each participant is interested in."
