nodes:
  Influencer: "Influencers are individuals who create content online. In our graph model, influencers can be either on Tiktok (TikTokUser) or YouTube (YouTubeChannel) social media platforms. Areas and Municipalities follow these influencers, representing the aggregated preferences of people living in those geographic regions."
  Area: "The Area node represents a specific geographic neighborhood or district. Currently, in our graph schema only areas within Rotterdam Municipality are supported. Never generate a cypher query when area that doesn't belong to Rotterdam municipality is requested. For instance, Charlois or Feijenoord would be valid Area nodes. IMPORTANT: Area nodes contain aggregated person data as array properties (e.g., person_age: StringArray, person_smoking_frequency: StringArray). These arrays represent the behaviors and characteristics of all people living in that area. When querying about people, youth, participants, individual characteristics, or querying for aggregated values from these properties, you must query these aggregated array properties on Area or Municipality nodes. Area nodes can follow Influencers via the FOLLOWS relationship."
  Municipality: "This is a larger administrative region that includes many Areas. For example, Rotterdam itself is a Municipality containing various Areas. We only support municipalities coming from the Rotterdam Rijmond Region. Never generate a cypher query when municipality that doesn't belong to Rotterdam Rijmond region is requested. IMPORTANT: Municipality nodes contain aggregated person data as array properties (e.g., person_age: StringArray, person_smoking_frequency: StringArray). These arrays represent the behaviors and characteristics of all people living in that municipality. When querying about people, youth, participants, individual characteristics, or querying for aggregated values from these properties, you must query these aggregated array properties on Municipality or Area nodes. Municipality nodes can follow Influencers via the FOLLOWS relationship."
  TikTokUser: "This node stands for a TikTok account that belongs to an Influencer. It's the representation of the influencer's presence on the TikTok platform."
  YouTubeChannel: "Similar to TiktokUser, this node represents an Influencer's YouTube channel, reflecting their presence on YouTube."
  TikTokVideo: "Tiktok Videos are the pieces of content published by TikTok influencers. These nodes capture details related to video content published by the TikTok influencer."
  YouTubeVideo: "YouTube Videos are the pieces of content published by Youtube influencers (YouTubeChannel). These nodes capture details related to video content published by the YouTube influencer."
  TikTokComment: "TikTok Comments are user interactions on TikTok videos. They can be from followers or viewers engaging with the content, or the influencers themselves. Sometimes comments have replies, which are also captured as nodes."
  YouTubeComment: "Comments are user interactions on videos. They can be from followers or viewers engaging with the content, and sometimes comments have replies, which are also captured as nodes."
  TikTokHashTag: "On TikTok, hashtags capture the keywords used on TikTok videos. TikTokHashTag nodes help categorize and spread content within the platform."
  TikTokSticker: "On TikTok, stickers are graphic elements added to TikTok videos. The TikTokSticker node represents these decorations and nuances in video content."
  YoutubeVideoTag: "Tags on YouTube videos work like keywords, and the Tag node captures these to help categorize YouTubeVideo by topic or theme."
  YoutubeVideoTopic: "Topic nodes on youtube videos represent the subject matter or themes of videos, like 'news', 'sports', or 'entertainment'. This helps us analyze what kinds of content participants are being exposed to."
relationships:
  BELONGS_TO: "An Area belongs to a Municipality, so this relationship represents the geographic hierarchy—like a neighborhood inside a city."
  HAS_ACCOUNT: "This connects an Influencer to their TikTok or YouTube platform accounts (TikTokUser or YouTubeChannel), forming a bridge between the influencer and their social media presence on TikTok or YouTube."
  HAS_VIDEO: "This relationship shows that an influencer, i.e. TikTokUser or YouTubeChannel published a particular video—in other words, it captures content creation."
  HAS_TAG: "Indicates that a Youtube or TikTok video includes a specific hashtag (TikTokHashTag or YoutubeVideoTag), helping us track how videos are categorized or spread."
  HAS_STICKER: "Connects a TikTok video to stickers used, showing the extra graphic details added to videos."
  HAS_COMMENT: "Links a TikTokVideo or YouTubeVideo to comments made by viewers or followers (TikTokComment or YouTubeComment), capturing audience engagement."
  HAS_TOPIC: "This connects a YouTube video to its Topic, specifying what the content is about. This helps us analyze trends in exposure and content types."
  FOLLOWS: "This relationship shows that an Area or Municipality follows an Influencer. The count property on the relationship indicates how many people in that geographic region follow the influencer. This represents aggregated following behavior at the area or municipality level."
